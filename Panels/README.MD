Panels are remote terminals connect to both the DB server and Nard server.<br>

Panels use the same image folder as the server, so copy them.

Panels do connect to the firebiard server thus need client access files loaded.
Run the firebird database server install and just uncheck server leaving client files selected and you should be good.<br>

Panels recv UDP packets from server when it's display needs to be refreshed also sends a packet to the server when issueing commands to connected nards.<br>

Using a touchscreen is workable, currently when you press down, have to wiggle your finger a bit to ger the mouse down event, mouse up when finger releases seems to be good.<br>
I was able to remote control a nardBot using this setup.<br>

fun stuff, enjoy.. ~q
